Analyzing COVID_19 Data with SQL: A Data-Driven Approach

Problem Statement: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, economies and societies. To better understand the spread of the virus and inform public health policy, we need to analyze the Covid-19 dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform our understanding of the pandemic.

DATA SOURCES: We used COVID-19 data from a publicly available dataset, which includes information on cases, deaths, vaccinations and recoveries by country and region. The data was collected from [OUR WORLD IN DATA](https://docs.owid.io/projects/etl/api/covid/%23downloaddata)

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this project are to:

•	Analyze COVID-19 data to Identify trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations.

•	Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries.

•	Determine the effectiveness of public health measures in controlling the spread of the virus.

•	Provide insights and recommendations for policy makers and public health officials

DATA ANALYSIS 
SQL QUERIES: We used SQL queries to extract COVID-19 data from the dataset. 

Some of the queries used include:

•	SELECT statements to extract specific columns and rows.

•	JOINS to combine data from multiple tables. 

•	GROUP BY statement to aggregate data by country and region.

•	Subqueries to extract complex data sets.

Technical Skills: 

•	SQL: Writing efficient and effective SQL queries, using subqueries and joins, optimizing SQL queries for performance.

Key findings and insights: 
Trends: Our analysis revealed that a significant increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time, with varying trends across different countries and continents.
Regional Impact: We found that certain regions such as Europe and North America were heavily impacted by the pandemic, while others such as Africa, Oceania and Asia had lower cases and death rate.
Public Health Measures:  Our analysis suggested that public health measures, such as lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing, hand washing and vaccinations if undertaken will be effective in controlling the spread of the virus.

Key Takeaways: 
Significant trends and patterns in COVID-19 data shows that United States had the highest death percentage, which is the percentage of individuals that died due to COVID-19.
Using the insights from the data it shows that Brazil, India, France, America, South Africa had the highest COVID-19 Virulence in South America, Asia, Europe, North America and Africa respectively. This shows the virulence of the disease and that France had the highest number of people infected with COVID-19 in Europe, closely followed by Russia and the United Kingdom. While in North America, America had the highest number of people infected with COVID-19 and it being at a very alarming rate.

It is important to note that Africa was amongst the least affected continent and its least affected countries, with the lowest rate of COVID-19 infections are Mauritius, Tanzania and Saint Helena. However, African's most affected countries with the highest rate of COVID-19 infections are South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia.

North America is the continent with the highest amount of deaths due to COVID-19 infections. The countries with the highest death count in the world is the United states followed by Brazil and others.
The countries in the world with the lowest death count is Curacao followed by Dominica and others. 

To know the COVID_19 new cases and new deaths per country, will help inform our decisions on the efficacy of the control measures in each locality. The country with the highest new cases and new deaths is the United states of America. The United states had the highest total cases of COVID _19 infections.
The continent with the highest vaccinated rate by population is Europe, Africa and Asia, While the lowest vaccinated by population is Oceania, North America and South America. While the continent with the lowest sanitization rate by population is Oceania, North America and Asia while Europe has the highest sanitization rate.

The country with the highest vaccinated rate by population is Gibraltar, Seychelles and Israel, however, the lowest vaccinated rate by population is Afghanistan, Algeria and North Macedonia. The country with the highest sanitization rate by population is Marshall Islands, Saint Lucia and Barbados. 
China had the highest amount of total vaccinations, followed by America and India, but compared to their population, their vaccination rate is low.

Recommendations: 
Vaccination efforts: To continue to promote vaccination as a crucial tool in preventing COVID_19 mortalities, especially in regions with low vaccination rates such as Afghanistan, Algeria and North Macedonia. Also use the insights above to analyze vaccination coverage and identify areas for improvement.
Targeted Interventions: Implement targeted public health measures in regions identified with high case numbers and death rates by increased testing, contact tracing, and social distance policies.

Healthcare Resource Allocation: Ensure adequate healthcare resources, including hospital beds, ICU capacity, ventilators and medical personnel are available in regions with high COVID_19 caseloads.

Impact: Findings and recommendations can inform public health policy and support decision-making.

Future work: Future work could include further analysis of the COVID-19 data, exploration of new data sources and analytics techniques, and development of predictive models to forecast COVID-19 trends.
