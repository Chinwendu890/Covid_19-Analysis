Analyzing COVID_19 Data with SQL: A Data-Driven Approach

Problem Statement: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, economies and societies. To better understand the spread of the virus and inform public health policy, we need to analyze the Covid-19 dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform our understanding of the pandemic.
DATA SOURCES: We used COVID-19 data from a publicly available dataset, which includes information on cases, deaths, vaccinations and recoveries by country and region. The data was collected from [OUR WORLD IN DATA](https://docs.owid.io/projects/etl/api/covid/%23downloaddata)

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this project are to:

•	Analyze COVID-19 data to Identify trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations.

•	Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries.

•	Determine the effectiveness of public health measures in controlling the spread of the virus.

•	Provide insights and recommendations for policy makers and public health officials

DATA ANALYSIS 
SQL QUERIES: We used SQL queries to extract COVID-19 data from the dataset. 

Some of the queries used include:

•	SELECT statements to extract specific columns and rows.

•	JOINS to combine data from multiple tables. 

•	GROUP BY statement to aggregate data by country and region.

•	Subqueries to extract complex data sets.

Technical Skills: 

•	SQL: Writing efficient and effective SQL queries, using subqueries and joins, optimizing SQL queries for performance.
